## 1. Introduction

This tiny tutorial is for those who are just starting to use a computer, like a 12-year-old. I'll help you to explore your computer and get familiar with the basics of how to use it.

### 1.1 What is this machine called a ‘computer’?

Nowadays, we see computers nearly everywhere. Yes, computers have become the fundamental things of our modern world. But, when you use a computer for the first time, have you wondered how does this thing actually work? And furthermore, why do people invent such things? 

Well, we learn basic math from primary school on. We learned to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. The process of performing these calculations is called computing. You might have used an electronic calculator, to calculate some bills or verify your math answers. In principle,  a computer's main function is also computing just like electronic calculators. However, a computer we use nowadays is much more complicated and powerful than a calculator. 

You're probably using a desktop computer or a laptop computer. These are called PCs, which stands for personal computers. A PC usually has a screen to display information, a keyboard, and a mouse or a touch pad for us to interact with it. It’s a machine that can store information and perform tasks based on what we tell it to do. Now that we've covered the basics, let's explore some components of your computer.

**Parts of a Computer:**

1. **The Monitor:** This is the screen where you can see things you’re doing. It’s like a TV for your computer.
2. **The Keyboard:** This is where you type letters, numbers, and symbols. It’s similar to a typewriter but with additional buttons.
3. **The Mouse:** This helps you point to things on the screen and click on them. It’s like a magic wand that lets you select what you want to do.
4. **The CPU (Central Processing Unit):** This is the “brain” of the computer. It does all the computing and processing.
5. **The Hard Drive:** This is where your computer stores all its files, like documents, pictures, and games. It’s like a big digital closet.
6. The RAM (Random Access Memory): This provides temporary storage for data that the CPU is actively using, which speeds up processing and multitasking. It functions like the working memory of a computer. If you shut down your computer, RAM will be cleared, but the hard drive will retain its stored information.  
7. **Speakers:** These let you hear sounds from your computer, like music or videos. They make the computer come alive with sound!

Well, for a laptop, you can usually see a foldable computer with its screen, keyboard and body fixed together and a power charger connected to it. The CPU, RAM, hard drives, speakers, battery, and other parts are all inside the body. There's also a touch pad near the keyboard, which enables you to control the cursor on screen without an external mouse. There is also a small fan at the bottom to cool the computer, as running computers generate heat that could damage the internal components if temperature gets too high. Therefore, place your laptop on a hard, flat surface, such as a desk, rather than on a bed. If you want to work comfortably in bed anyway, consider using a laptop cooling pad or a portable desk to keep your laptop elevated and ensure proper airflow. This setup will help prevent overheating.

For a desktop computer, it's monitor, keyboard, and mouse are usually independent and connected to a box, which is called the "tower case" or "computer case". The computer case houses the CPU, hard drives and other parts of the computer. It also has a fan to cool down essential components of the computer like CPU, RAM. Make sure to keep the airflow unobstructed to prevent overheating. 

**How Computers Help Us:**

- **Learning:** Computers can help you learn new things through educational games and videos.
- **Creating:** You can draw, write stories, and make music using computer programs.
- **Connecting:** Computers help you talk to friends and family through messages or video calls.
- **Working and Entertainment:** Most office workers need computers for their work, and we can also play games on a computer for fun.

For a PC, we can see it as a powerful tool for both work and daily life. There are also other types of computers, such as supercomputers for massive data processing, servers for Internet services, and embedded computers in cars and even rockets.

Now that you know what a computer is and some of its main parts, let’s explore how to use it.

### 1.2 How to Use a Computer

**(1) Turn on Your Computer**

The first step to using a computer is to power it on. Plug in the power cable, then press the power button. Once the computer starts up, it will go through a booting process where the operating system loads. You will probably see the power-on animation. After this, you'll see the desktop or home screen. From there, you can open applications, browse the Internet, or begin your tasks. If needed, log in with your username and password to access your personal settings and files.

So... what is an operating system? Why do we need it?

An operating system (OS) is software that manages the computer's hardware and provides a user interface. It enables the computer to run applications and perform tasks by handling processes such as memory management, file storage, and device control. We need an OS because it acts as an intermediary between the user and the hardware, making it possible to use and manage the computer efficiently.

An operating system is like the conductor of an orchestra. It ensures all the different parts of your computer work together smoothly so you can play games, do work, or watch videos. Without it, your computer wouldn't function properly. You might have heard of Microsoft, the tech giant. Most PCs use Windows (an operating system), which is made by Microsoft. Others use macOS, made by Apple, or various distributions of Linux, which is developed by a global community of contributors.

**(2) How to run a program** 

For most personal computers, you'll see the home screen after starting up. There will be some icons for programs, such as File Explorer and Internet Browser. Usually you can simply use your mouse to move the cursor over the icon and double-click the left mouse button. Double click means quickly pressing and releasing the left mouse button twice in rapid succession. It's commonly used to open files, folders, or programs. When the program starts, it will usually show a graphic window for you to interact with. 

A program is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a specific task. Think of it as a recipe: just like a recipe tells you how to make a dish, a program tells the computer how to do something, whether it’s adding numbers, displaying text, or handling data. Well, "program" is a general term  for any software that runs on a computer. More often, you'll see a type of program that performs a specific set of functions for the user, usually with a user interface that makes it easy to interact with. That's called an application specifically.

- Locate the program 

  If there is a shortcut icon on the desktop, double-click it. 

  if not, try searching it in the following ways:

  - **Start Menu (Windows)**:
    - Click on the **Start** button (usually at the bottom-left corner of the screen).
    - Look for a list of applications or programs in the menu.
    - Click on the program you want to run (such as Microsoft Word, Calculator).
  - **Dock or Launchpad (MacOS)**:
    - Click on the **Launchpad** icon (usually looks like a rocket) in the dock.
    - Find the application you want to open.
    - Click on the application icon.

- Run the program

  Click the program icon from the Windows Start Menu or macOS Launchpad. If you find an icon of the program on the desktop, double-click it to run it. Usually a window will pop up for you to interact with. 

- Close the program

  There will be an 'X' button at the top-right corner of the program's window in Windows. And you can close off a program by clicking the red circle button at the top-left corner of the program' window in MacOS. 

Tips:

  - Remember to save your files if you are working with them.

**(3) How to browse the Internet by a Internet Browser**

Well, you might have already heard of the Internet and have experience using it. If your computer is connected to the Internet, whether by Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity), an Ethernet cable, or other methods, you'll be able to access countless websites and communicate with friends even if they are thousands of kilometers away. This also means you can read this article and explore more information.

There are many different browsers, such as Edge, Chrome, and Firefox. To visit a website using a browser, open the browser, type the website's URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into the address bar at the top, and press Enter. The browser will then take you to that website. The 'Enter' key on a computer keyboard, also known as the 'Return' key, is used to execute commands, confirm actions, or move to the next line in text fields. In the browser's address bar, pressing the 'Enter' key means to 'confirm and go to that website.'

If you don't know the exact URL of a website, you can use search engines like Google ([www.google.com](https://www.google.com/)), Bing ([www.bing.com](https://www.bing.com/)), or Baidu ([www.baidu.com](https://www.baidu.com/)). Simply type what you want to search for on the Internet, then hit 'Enter,' and the search engine will show you the results.

Tips:

- Always be cautious when using the Internet. Don’t share personal information with strangers.
- Be aware of fraud and misleading information on the Internet.

**(4) How to use the file system**

You already know that hard drives in a computer store files even when the power is off. So how do we access and manage these files?

Well, operating systems are in charge of managing these files in an organized way. Your computer's operating system organizes all data on hard drives using a file system. A file system is like a giant digital filing cabinet where all your files are stored. Just like a real filing cabinet has drawers to keep things organized, a computer’s file system has folders or directories. Folders and directories refer to the same thing: containers used to organize files. While the terms can be used interchangeably, "folder" is more user-friendly and often used in a graphical environment, whereas "directory" is more technical.

In a folder, there can be many files and many folders. It can also be empty. If you have seen a file in a folder, you might have noticed that a file's full name usually has a base name and an extension that starts with a dot after the file's base name, like "cat.png". A file extension is like a label at the end of a file's name that tells the computer what kind of file it is and which program can open it. For example, with "cat.png", the base name is "cat" and the extension is ".png". This indicates that it is a PNG file, a type of picture format, and should be opened with an image viewer program.

In a PC's file explorer, you can usually navigate through folders by double-clicking on them and navigate back to the parent folder using an arrow icon at the top of the file explorer.

**(5) How to Shut Down Your Computer**

Unlike other electrical devices like lamps, you should not simply unplug a computer to shut it down. Doing so may result in unsaved files or even damage your PC. Instead, you should use the operating system to shut down your computer safely, ensuring that your files are saved and settings are stored properly.

**For Windows PC:**

1. **Save Your Work:**
   - Make sure all your work is saved and all applications are closed.

2. **Open the Start Menu:**
   - Click on the **Start** button at the bottom-left corner of your screen (Windows icon).

3. **Access Power Options:**
   - Click on the **Power** icon, which looks like a circle with a vertical line at the top.

4. **Select Shut Down:**
   - Choose **Shut down** from the options provided.
   - Confirm any prompts to save your work or close applications if necessary.

5. **Wait for Shutdown:**
   - Allow the PC to complete the shutdown process. The screen will turn black when the computer is fully off.

**For Mac:**

1. **Save Your Work:**
   - Ensure all files are saved and applications are closed.

2. **Open the Apple Menu:**
   - Click on the **Apple** logo in the top-left corner of your screen.

3. **Select Shut Down:**
   - Choose **Shut Down...** from the drop-down menu.

4. **Confirm Shutdown:**
   - In the dialog box that appears, confirm your choice by clicking **Shut Down**.
   - Optionally, you can check the box to reopen windows upon the next login if desired.

5. **Wait for Shutdown:**
   - Let the Mac complete the shutdown process. The screen will go dark when the computer is fully turned off.

**Tips:**

- **Avoid Forced Shutdowns:** Only press and hold the power button if the computer is unresponsive, as this can lead to data loss or corruption.
- **Log Out First:** For shared computers, consider logging out of your user account before shutting down.
- **Check for Updates:** Occasionally, your computer might need to install updates during shutdown, so allow it to complete these tasks to avoid future issues.

By following these steps, you ensure a proper shutdown process that helps maintain the health and longevity of your PC.
